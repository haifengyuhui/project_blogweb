# project_blogweb
This project aims to study how to create a website.
The concerning study link is at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uh411f7YC/?p=2&spm_id_from=pageDriver&vd_source=d04928614407e431665d67b522b34995 in BiliBili.
Here, I complete learning the full process and give some methods to solve the unexpected problems. You could see my notes in my blog passage at https://blog.csdn.net/castlegirl/article/details/135075747?spm=1001.2014.3001.5502.
By the way, wish my experience can help some of you.

Attention:
1. Need to enter into the Redis: redis-server.
2. Need to change the blog.settings.py: 'USER': 'xxxxxxxx', 'PASSWORD': 'xxxxxxxx'.
